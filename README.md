## WIP Portfolio Site / Playground  

This is an Angular project that I intend on turning into a personal portfolio site sometime.  
For now, it's serving as a testing space while I learn cool things.  
The site is currently deployed [here](https://katsinskyd.github.io/portfolio).  

### Things I'm Working On  

- I'm aware that the profile photo I've added isn't displaying correctly (it does locally!)  
- For the "RNG RPG" I need to figure out the enemy level scaling and add some more interesting actions to spice things up.  
- I'm going to end up changing the entire design of the site at some point, so I've been looking for inspiration and sketching wireframes.
