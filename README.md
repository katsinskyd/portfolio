## WIP Portfolio Site / Playground  

This is an Angular project that I intend on turning into a personal portfolio site sometime.  
For now, it's serving as a testing space while I learn cool things.  
The site is currently deployed [here](https://katsinskyd.github.io/portfolio).  

### Things I'm Working On  

- For "RNG RPG" I want to add some more events the player can experience (not sure what yet)    
- I'm going to end up changing the entire design of the site at some point, so I've been looking for inspiration and sketching wireframes.
