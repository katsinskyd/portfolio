        <p>I am a nonbinary web developer and artist. My pronouns are she/they.<br>
    I focus primarily on full stack development using Java and Javascript.<br>
    A lot of my art is based off of whatever anime or vtuber I'm watching at the moment, or inspired by rhythm games.<br>
    Besides programming and art, I enjoy learning Japanese, livestreaming, and cosplay!</p>
